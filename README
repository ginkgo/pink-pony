Pink Pony is super pre-alpha, so don't expect too much. :)

== COMPILING ==

You will need the following tools and libraries to build the game:

* SCons
* GLFW
* IlmBase
* DevIL
* google protobuf
* audiere

Just build the game with "scons" in the current directory. If you have
a dualcore CPU, you can use "scons -j2" for parallel building.

== PLAYING ==

To start the game, call "./Pony". ESC stops the game.

You can take screenshots with the SPACE bar.

Controls:

Pony 1: Arrow Keys
Pony 2: WASD
Pony 3: 8456 on the Numpad
Pony 4: IJKL

Additionally you can use gamepads. Joystick 1 controls Pony 1, etc.
You steer the ponies with the left/right axis of the main stick and
accelerate/decelerate with Button 1 and 2. 

Many keyboards have problems with too many simultaneous keystrokes. If
you have problems with more than two players, you can attach an
additional USB keyboard or use Gamepads for some players.


== CONFIGURATION ==

You can configure a lot of things in the games config file
"pony.options".
You can supply an alternative config file as option in the "./Pony" call.

== LICENSE ==
