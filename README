This is a super pre-alpha release, so don't expect too much. :)

You will need the following tools and libraries to build the game:

* SCons
* GLFW
* OpenEXR

Just build the game with "scons" in the current directory. If you have
a dualcore CPU, you can use "scons -j2" for parallel building.

To start the game, call "./Pony". You can control the first pony with
the arrow-keys. ESC stops the game.

You can configure a lot of things in the games config file
"pony.options".
You can supply an alternative config file as option in the "./Pony" call.
