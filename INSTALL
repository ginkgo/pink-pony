If you just want to compile and play Pink Pony, do the following:

scons
./Pony

You will need the following tools/libraries:

* SCons (for building)
* GLFW
* IlmBase
* DevIL
* protobuf (You also need protobuf-compiler on ubuntu)
* audiere
* FTGL
* libsigc++

*** Information for package maintainers ***

The best way to integrate Pink Pony as package to a distribution is to do the following:

* Compile the game with 'scons'

* Copy the following files & folders to a directory like /usr/share/pink-pony:

  README GLSL fonts levels models music textures pony.options level.xml Pony

* Modify the script 'install/pink-pony' to use the directory where you
  installed the game resources and put it into a bin directory that is
  in your system path.

  This is a simple shell script, that changes into the resource
  directory and calls the 'Pony' executable with
  ~/.config/pony.options as config file.
  This way every user gets access to the game and can configure it to
  his/her liking.

  Users can now just call '$ pink-pony' and play the game without
  having to worry about being in the correct working directory or
  supplying a config file.

* You can use the 'install/pink-pony.desktop' and
  'install/pink-pony.png' files to install the games in desktop
  environments.
